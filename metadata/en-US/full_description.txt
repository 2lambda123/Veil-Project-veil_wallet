Veil - Privacy without compromise

Veil is creating an encrypted equivalent of the cash economy, where privacy is the most convenient choice. Learn more, download the wallet, and join the journey. 

PRIVACY BY DEFAULT

Privacy should not be optional. Veil aims to make full-time privacy the most convenient choice.

INCENTIVIZED PARTICIPATION

By holding Veil, our users not only contribute to broadly distributed network security, but earn staking rewards â€” anonymously!

FAIR LAUNCH

No ICO. No premine. Veil's blockchain is secured via Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake in order to combine both security and fair distribution.

USER-FOCUSED

In a digital cash society, participation extends to everybody, not just those who read user manuals. Veil aims to be one of the most user-friendly wallets in crypto.

SELF-SUSTAINING

The Veil network includes built-in self-funding for project development, operations, customer support, and ongoing research and development.

FUTURE-SAFE

Veil will continue to push the limits of cryptography and blockchain technology through Veil Labs, an entity dedicated to R&D and partnerships with leading academic institutions.
